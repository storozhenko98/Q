# Q

Q is a CLI tool that puts an LLM in your terminal. 

## Installation
First, make sure you have Go installed. Then, copy this repo. 
Finally, run ```bash ./bai.sh``` to install Q to your system.
If there is an issue, ensure you have execute permissions for bai.sh by running ```chmod +x bai.sh```.
This should add Q to your path. 

This is a super early version, so please report any issues you find. I am new to Golang so this is 
kind of preliminary. But so far I like go, and I want to make this project work.
